	<h3>Usage</h3><hr>
	<h4>Add an Account</h4>
	<p>
		Right click the Main Launcher Window to reveal a context menu, then select <i>Add New</i>. The Add Account window will then pop up. Fill out all the information it asks for, then hit Add.
		The new account will now appear in the main form list. Double click to launch.
	</p>
	<h4>Remove an Account</h4>
	<p>
		Right click the Main Launcher Window to reveal a context menu, then select <i>Remove Selected</i>. The selected account on the main list will then be deleted.
	</p>
	<h4>Edit Account Information (Accounts.json)</h4>
	<p>
		Currently there is no way to modify or edit account information within the GUI. However the JSON file that houses the account info is easy to understand and modify.<br>
		Here is an example of the Accounts.json:
		<pre>
[
  {
    "email": "derp@derperkins.derp",
    "password": "derpyderp",
    "character": "D E R P Y",
    "gwpath": "C:\\Derp\\GW\\Gw.exe",
    "datfix": true
  },
  {
    "email": "derp1@derperkins.derp",
    "password": "asf",
    "character": "Derpyless Derp",
    "gwpath": "C:\\Derp\\GW\\Gw.exe",
    "datfix": true
  },
  {
    "email": "derp2@derperkins.derp",
    "password": "poop",
    "character": "Werpy Derp",
    "gwpath": "C:\\Derp\\GW3\\Gw.exe",
    "datfix": false
  },
  {
    "email": "derp3@derperkins.derp",
    "password": "iamsomature",
    "character": "Derrrrrp Derp",
    "gwpath": "C:\\Derp\\GW2\\Gw.exe",
    "datfix": false
  },
  {
    "email": "derp4@derperkins.derp",
    "password": "I<3GWLauncher",
    "character": "So Much Derp",
    "gwpath": "C:\\Derp\\GW1\\Gw.exe",
    "datfix": false
  }
]
		</pre>
		
		This format is fairly straight forward, modify the account info of the selected account, then save the file and re-launch GW Launcher.exe.
	</p>
	<h4>About the .dat patch</h4>
	<p>
		The dat patch as stated above will allow you to run as many clients as you want off of one installation, however there are negative side effects of the clients patched. These effects include:
		<ul>
			<li>Inventory item icons have a chance of never appearing (empty slot), however the quantity number will always appear.</li>
			<li>Game updates will fail to update, will cause a hang come updates. (Run the Guild Wars client normally to update in order to fix this)</li>
			<li>If the game crashes, there is no chance of a reconnect to be possible.</li>
		</ul>
		There may be more side effects, however these are the effects I have seen. The general problem is that any process involving writing to Gw.dat will fail.
	</p>
	<h4>GW Plugins</h4>
	<p>
		Well, since you read this far, ill tell you another feature not noted in the overview. If you create a folder named "plugins" within the Gw.exe folder, the launcher will load all .dll's inside this folder on launch.
		This is beneficial for many reasons as you can load plugins and modules at runtime, for example umod's d3d9.dll can be loaded, avoiding the global hook and its side effects. (uMod's d3d9 dll allows for you to close uMod after launch and is significantly less taxing on performance.)
		I hope that this feature comes in handy to people.
